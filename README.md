# ML II Abschlussprojekt 

## Goal / Motivation: 

**Goal**:  The goal of this ML project is to develop a system that can recommend similar and more affordable skincare products based on the ingredients of a given product. It should employ a machine learning model to accurately determine the similarity between products based on their ingredients.

**Movitvation**: The motivation behind the project is that when I am on holiday, I often go to drugstores or pharmacies in the respective countries and want to discover new skin care products. Sometimes I buy expensive skincare products that I would never buy in Switzerland. I have to say that I love skincare products and enjoy discovering new ones. When they run out and I like them, I want to find alternatives without wasting my time searching the internet for a similar product. The aim is to have several products as an outtput that have similar ingredients. That way I can concentrate my research on these products and then hopefully try another product. By research I mean reading up on the products, reading reviews and so on
